# Changelog

## [v0.3.4](https://github.com/intel/xetla/releases/tag/v0.3.4) (2023-08-18)
- New Features
  * Enabled limitation checking.
  * Provided "XETLA_PRINTF" and "XETLA_ASSERT" for debugging.
  * Refined fpu based GEMM.
  * Refined tile reduce APIs, deprecated API "tile_row_reduce".
  * Supported new data type int4 (experimental feature).
  * Fixed tile load/store bugs.
  * Enhanced examples, tests, and updated documents.

- Known Issues
    - Refer to [Limitations](/media/docs/limitations.md).

 ## [v0.3.3](https://github.com/intel/xetla/releases/tag/v0.3.3) (2023-06-30)
- New Features
  * Enabled debug build support.
  * Updated documents, added some diagrams and details.
  * Fixed some customer reported issues.
  * Improved the project's quality.

- Known Issues
    - Refer to [Limitations](/media/docs/limitations.md).

## [v0.3.2](https://github.com/intel/xetla/releases/tag/v0.3.2) (2023-06-16)
- New Features
  * Added some kernel-level APIs' parameters check functions, users need to explicit call them before launch the kernel; will return fail and print error messages when detect unsupported scenarios, continue launching the kernel for unspported scenarios may lead to unpredictable result.
  * Removed reduce_sum + tile_op epilogue policy.
  * Added some unit test cases.
  * Refined some examples code.
  * Updated documents, added some diagrams and details.
  * Fixed some customer reported issues.
  * Improved the project's quality.

- Known Issues
    - Refer to [Limitations](/media/docs/limitations.md).

- New Features
  * Initial open source release.
  * Improved sub-group level fundamental features: core, tile, utils.
  * Enhanced basic BRGEMM micro-kernels for different data types as well as different epilogue flavours.
  * Unified the examples: basic BRGEMM, GEMM; fusion BRGEMM, GEMM; batched GEMM; MLP, GRU, MHA.
  * Added some unit test cases.

- Known Issues
