# Limitations

## GEMM
GEMM kernel provides a function `can_implement` to filter the limitations, call it to check the parameters before run GEMM kernel.

- Matrix Mutilple Accumulation (tile_mma)
    - Sub-group tile size on column, `tile_shape::sg_tile_size_x` must be a multiple of 16.
    - Sub-group tile size on row, `tile_shape::sg_tile_size_y` must be a multiple of 8 in matrix-engine-based GEMM.
    - The tile size consumed by each step on the reduction dimension, `k_stride * sizeof(dtype)` must be 32B in vector-engine-based GEMM, multiply of 32B in matrix-engine-based GEMM.
- Global Memory Access
    - Base-address of the matrix must be 64B aligned.
    - Leading-dimension size of the matrix must be multiple of 8B aligned and must be equal or greater than 64B.
    - Width size of the matrix must be 4B aligned and must be equal or greater than 64B.
- Local Memory Access
    - Base-address of the matrix must be 4B aligned.
    - The matrix layout in local memory must be row-major.
    - Loading Matrix A and B works only when the  `mma_engine` is `mma_engine::fpu`.
    - GEMM size must be divisible by the sub-group tile size on both row and column dimension.
