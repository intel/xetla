# Config that uses cx_Freeze to build a python program to a binary
_doc: "cx_Freeze python builder"

# cx_Freeze needs a setup.py to package a python programming.
# The test framework provides a default one to allow user to just config pyexe_cfg.yaml
# to use the cx_Freeze
# If the default implementation can't meet your requirement,
# you can provide your own _setup_file absolute path.
_setup_file: "default"

# We can use multiple '_py_packages', like '_py_packages_common' and '_py_packages_case_1'
# All attributes start with '_py_packages' will be combined to config the python packages required.
_py_packages: [ ]

# _py_executables config the python files to be packaged
_py_executables: [ ]

# _py_copy_files config other files to copy to dist folder
# example:
#  _py_copy_files: [ [ src_file_1, dst_file_1 ],
#                    [ src_file_2, dst_file_2 ]]
# the src file path should be the absolute path
# the dst file path should be relative path to build output
